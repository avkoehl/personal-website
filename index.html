          I am an undergraduate at the University of California at Davis where I pursue a triple major in computer science, economics and history.
          I work with Dr. Carl Stahmer at the Digital Scholars Lab and the Data Science Initative.
          Increasingly, I am integrating digital methods in my research.
          My interests are in quantitative approaches to cultural and military history.

            Malgre-Nous - A digital initiative to represent their story 
          </h3>
          <p>
          Between 1942 to 1945, approximately 130,000 young men from Moselle and Alsace were conscripted into the German Army. 
          They are called the "Malgre-Nous" (despite-us in English) in reference to the fact that they were fighting against their will for a country that was not their own. 
          This web project takes a different approach to presenting the story of the Malgre-Nous.
          It seeks to lay the foundations for a more complete view of their experience by using data, maps, and visualizations to generate a more comprehensive picture of their presence on the multiple fronts in Europe during the Second World War.

            Archive-Vision - CBIR for Early Modern imagesets
          </h3>
          <p>
          The digitization of historical imagesets has vastly outpaced our ability to meaningfully search those sets.
          Archive-Vision (Arch-V) allows users to query a library of images using an existing image as a seed.
          Arch-V uses SURF feature dectection and description to find scale and rotation invariant keypoints on images.
          The keypoints of the seed image are then compared with those of the images in the set.
          The matching keypoints are then filtered using their geometric descriptors and statistical methods. 
          Using the robust matching keypoints, the best matching images to the seed image are found.
